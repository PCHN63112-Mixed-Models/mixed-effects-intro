    "# Mixed-effects Models in `R`\n",
    "As the final part of this lesson, we turn to the process of fitting LME models using `R`, as well as options around inference. These examples will all be fairly basic, but we will see more variety in the workshop this week. In addition, we will see that there are *two* main options in `R` for fitting LME models. The first is the `lme()` function from the `nlme` package and the second is the `lmer()` function from the `lme4` package. We will discuss both below, as well as their advantages and disadvantages."

    "## Fitting Mixed-effects Models with `nlme`\n",
    "We will start with the `nlme` package, both because it is the *older* of the two and because it is already familiar from the `gls()` function. To fit a LME model, we use the `lme()` function, which has a syntax very similar to the `gls()` function, but with the addition of a `random=` option for specifying the random effects. To understand how to use this, we will return to the long-formatted `anxiety` data from `datarium`."

    "### Specifying Random-effects\n",
    "As we can see above, the newest element of the `lme()` function is the `random=` argument. This uses a syntax very similar to what we have seen before when using `correlation=` and `weights=` with `gls()`. However, we need to think about this a little differently because we are not defining how we want a particular covariance structure to apply to the data. Instead, we are giving the *structure* of the random effects. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so the *fixed-effects* part just appears in the model equation as `score ~ time`. The *random-effects* part consists of $\\xi_{i} + \\eta_{ij}$, but we do not need to specify $\\eta_{ij}$ because that is the residual error term that is *always* included in a linear model. We know this already from `lm()` as we never have to ask for residuals, they are always there. So, the only thing that differentiates the model above from something we could fit with `lm()` is the term $\\xi_{i}$. This is *precisely* what we specify using the `random=` argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is $\\xi_{i}$? Well, if we look at its index, it is a value that changes with *each subject*. It is therefore *constant* within a subject, but different between subjects. So how do we specify a value that is only constant *within* each subject? Well, we represent it as a constant using a `1` but make it *conditional* on the subject by using `|id`. So `1|id` can be read as *a constant per-subject*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can go back to the multilevel conceptualisation and think of this as describing the model that we fit to each individual subject. We will use some pseudo-code below to get the idea across, just be aware that most of this is not valid `lme()` syntax (but the ideas are hopefully clear). As described earlier, when we have *no replications* within each level of the repeated measures, the best we can do with the data from *one* subject is fit a constant. So our model for one subject would be something like\n",
    "\n",
    "`score[id == 1] ~ 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted this to work for *all* subjects, we would need to indicate that we want a *different* constant for each subject, which would give something like\n",
    "\n",
    "`score ~ 1|id`\n",
    "\n",
    "which we can read as \"fit a constant *separately* for each level of `id`\". \n",

    "Once we have multiple subjects, we have the option of estimating values by pooling data *across* subjects. So, with multiple subjects, we can add a fixed-effect of `time`. Using our current pseudo-code, this would give\n",
    "\n",
    "`score ~ 1|id + time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is *not* how `lme()` works. Instead, in order to clearly differentiate the random-effects from the fixed-effects, `lme()` requires that we move anything random out of the model equation and put it in a separate argument. So this gives the final *real* specification of\n",

    "\n",
    "The *fixed-effects* are interpreted in the same way as with `lm()`. Because `time` is categorical, `R` has converted it to a dummy variable. To make the model identifiable, `time1` has been dropped, so we have a dummy for `time2` and a dummy for `time3`. The `(Intercept)` parameter is therefore the mean value of `score` for `time1`, the `time2` parameter is the difference `time2 - time1`, and the `time3` parameter is the difference `time3 - time1`. This is exactly the same as we have seen previously with any linear model containing a categorical predictor variable. The *fixed-effects* therefore give us our predictions for the *marginal* means. In other words, when we *average across* the subjects. These are the model predictions for the population-level effects, in the same way that they would from a usual call to `lme()`.\n",

    "The difference of course is that we now also have the *random-effects*. We can think of these as *error-terms*, either using an LME model conceptualisation of a model with *multiple* errors, or using a multilevel model conceptualisation of different errors at each *level* of the hierarchy.

This is no different to the errors in a normal linear model, which are used to estimate $\\sigma^{2}$. The difference now is that this overall variance has been *partitioned* into $\\sigma^{2} = \\sigma^{2}_{b} + \\sigma^{2}_{w}$.\n",

The `Residual` term corresponds to $\\eta_{ij}$ and thus the estimate of $\\sigma^{2}_{w} = 0.30^{2}$.

So the expected values of both $\\xi_{i}$ and $\\eta_{ij}$ are 0. This is why the expected population effect is driven purely by the fixed-effects because, on average, the errors are 0. Secondly, the distribution of $\\xi_{i}$ is *much wider* than the distribution of $\\eta_{ij}$. This is because the distribution of $\\xi_{i}$ reflects measurements from *different subjects* and the distribution of $\\eta_{ij}$ reflects measurements from the *same subject*."

    "... From this perspective, a mixed-effects model is simply GLS, but with a more sophisticated way of constructing the variance-covariance matrix using the random effects. This leads to some important consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The inferential issues around GLS are *identical* for mixed-effects\n",
    "2. The covariance structure is *more restricted* under mixed-effects, because it is constrained by the random effects themselves \n",
    "\n",
    "... The advantages of GLS are still there. For instance, the correct error term for each test can be automatically generated from the covariance structure. So while the model itself may be no better than the repeated measures ANOVA, it is infinitely *more practical* because we do not need to mess around manually assigning error terms to different tests (and worrying about getting this wrong)."
