    "# The Multilevel Framework\n",
    "We will start our journey into the world of mixed-effects models from the perspective of a *multilevel* model. This is primarily because we can build the pieces of a mixed-effects model very slowly from first principles, allowing the logic to become much clearer. In addition, the multilevel framework is often the most *intuitive* way to think about these models, they are just less frequently implemented in this fashion. So, we generally advise to *think* about these models in a multilevel fashion, even if *practically* we end up specifying them in a mixed-effects fashion. This will all become clearer once we have discussed *both* perspectives. "

We also need to *estimate* both of these variances from the data in order to complete the unknowns for this model. Last semester, our focus was almost exclusively on the *mean function*, but now we can see that we are shifting focus and adding complexity to the *variance function*. This means that our mental model of where our data comes from now consists of *two layers*. This is precisely the conceptualisation that a multilevel model makes explicit."

The difference now is that we also imagine that each individual subject from that population will be *offset* by a certain amount. This implies that the *relative* differences in `score` between the levels of `time` is constant in the population, but that the *absolute* value of `score` depends on individual subjects. This captures the idea that a single subject may have an overall *lower* or *higher* value of `score` because each individual will have their own unique level of self-esteem. While the `time` manipulation may serve to *increase* or *decrease* self-esteem, someone with *low* self-esteem will still remain *low* even after the effect of `time`. Similarly, someone with *high* self-esteem will still remain *high*, even after the effect of `time`.

The errors at this level correspond to deviations in the value of `score` from the expected value for each subject specifically.

    "Notice anything familiar here? For starters, the simulated values of `time` are *correlated*. This is not necessarily surprising, except for the fact that *we did not simulate any correlation*. There is no multivariate normal distribution with a given correlation structure anywhere in the code above. So where did the correlation come from? This is actually a *natural consequence* of the algebra of a multilevel model. We do not need to specify correlation because it happens *automatically* as part of the connection between the levels of the model. This feels a bit like a magic trick, but we can see it clearly above.  "
