    "# The Multilevel Framework\n",
    "We will start our journey into the world of mixed-effects models from the perspective of a *multilevel* model. This is primarily because we can build the pieces of a mixed-effects model very slowly from first principles, allowing the logic to become much clearer. In addition, the multilevel framework is often the most *intuitive* way to think about these models, they are just less frequently implemented in this fashion. So, we generally advise to *think* about these models in a multilevel fashion, even if *practically* we end up specifying them in a mixed-effects fashion. This will all become clearer once we have discussed *both* perspectives. "

We already know this about $\\eta_{ij}$ because we always think of the errors as random and ascribe them a probability distribution. So this is nothing new. What *is* new is having *another random variable in the model*. In fact, pretty much every complication that follows is a direct knock-on effect of having *multiple random variables* in the model."

Clearly these are *not* 0 because they are on the same scale as `score`. So, instead, the expected value of each of these subject-specific means will be whatever the *population grand mean* is.

These distributions have different variances ($\\sigma^{2}_{1}$ and $\\sigma^{2}_{2}$), meaning we have *two* sources of error to now consider. We also need to *estimate* both of these variances from the data in order to complete the unknowns for this model. Last semester, our focus was almost exclusively on the *mean function*, but now we can see that we are shifting focus and adding complexity to the *variance function*. This means that our mental model of where our data comes from now consists of *two layers*, which is precisely the conceptualisation that a multilevel model makes explicit, as we will now discuss."

    "So, we can see where the term *multilevel* comes from, as we are thinking of our data-generation as occurring at *two levels* or *layers*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 1\n",
    "At Level 1, our data are drawn from a normal distribution with a mean that depends upon two parts. The first is *unique* and *specific* to subject $i$, and the second is *constant* across subjects. We imagine that, at the level of the *population*, the effect of the experimental manipulation is the *same* for every subject. However, we also imagine that each subject will be *offset* by a certain amount. This captures the idea that the *relative* differences in `score` between the levels of `time` is constant in the population, but that the *absolute* value of `score` depends on individual subjects. This captures the idea that `time` has an average effect across all subjects that we are attempting to capture. This is no different to any other effect we have tried to capture in models before. What *is* different is the idea that each subject has their own unique *offset*. This captures the idea that a single subject may have an overall *lower* or *higher* value of `score`. Individual subjects will have their own unique level of self-esteem. While the `time` manipulation may serve to *increase* or *decrease* self-esteem, someone with *low* self-esteem will still remain *low* even after the effect of `time`. Similarly, someone with *high* self-esteem will still remain *high*, even after the effect of `time`. The measurements from each individual subject are therefore *connected* by the $\\mu_{i}$ term, which is an important insight we will explore more below. In sum, we can think of Level 1 as explaining each subject as an individual entity and thus forming the individual models of each subject separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 2\n",
    "At Level 2, our data are drawn from ... This also implies a *hierarchy* of data-generation, where the data at Level 1 depends upon the data at Level 2. This is why these types of model are also known as *hierarchical* linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write this model in a slightly different way. As we know from last semester, we can always separate a probability model into an equation for the expected value plus random error. So, if we apply that principle here we can rewrite the above as\n",
    "\n",

    "    y_{ij}    &= \\mu_{i} + \\alpha_{j} + \\eta_{ij}  \\\\\n",

    "     S_{i}    &\\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\sigma^{2}_{b}\\right)   \\\\\n",

    "\\end{alignat*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it explicit that what each distribution is capturing is *error variance*. From this perspective, the random element of $\\mu_{i}$ is the error-term $S_{i}$. So what we *really* have is a model with *two sets of errors*. Each type of error captures a different form of *deflection* and thus a different *source of variance* ... So, we can see that we have now managed to describe our data in terms of *two* linear models. One of these models explains ... The other model explains ... Importantly, these two models are *connected*. "
