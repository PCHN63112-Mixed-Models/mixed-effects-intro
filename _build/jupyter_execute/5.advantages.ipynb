    "### Modelling Data Structure\n",
    "... In our previous discussion, GLS was used as a method to get around the presence of correlation within repeated measurement data. We impose a structure for GLS to remove. What LME models do instead is get us to model the *structure* of the data. We do not worry about dependence because this is accommodated *automatically* as a consequence of the structure. As long as we get the structure right, everything else follows. So this is an entirely different perspective. We are not trying to model correlation, we are trying to get the structure correct. Once we do, everything gets worked out for us, correlation and all. "
