    "# Mixed-effects Models in `R`\n",
    "As the final part of this lesson, we turn to the process of fitting LME models using `R`, as well as options around inference. These examples will all be fairly basic, but we will see more variety in the workshop this week. In addition, our focus will be on the `nlme` package to keep things simple. In reality, there are *two* `R` packages that are used frequently in practice: `nlme` and `lme4`. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, however, they are so similar that knowing one would easily allow you to use the other. For our purpose, the advantages of `lme4` are few at present and so we stick with `nlme` to reduce confusion."

This uses a syntax very similar to what we have seen before when using `correlation=` and `weights=` with `gls()`. However, we need to think about this a little differently because we are not defining how we want a particular covariance structure to apply to the data.

The *random-effects* part consists of $\\xi_{i} + \\eta_{ij}$, but we do not need to specify $\\eta_{ij}$ because that is the residual error term that is *always* included in a linear model. We know this already from `lm()` as we never have to ask for residuals, they are always there. So, the only thing that differentiates the model above from something we could fit with `lm()` is the term $\\xi_{i}$. This is *precisely* what we specify using the `random=` argument. \n",

So how do we specify a value that is only constant *within* each subject? Well, we represent it as a constant using a `1` but make it *conditional* on the subject by using `|id`.

    "The *fixed-effects* are interpreted in the same way as with `lm()`. Because `time` is categorical, `R` has converted it to a dummy variable. To make the model identifiable, `time1` has been dropped, so we have a dummy for `time2` and a dummy for `time3`. The `(Intercept)` parameter is therefore the mean value of `score` for `time1`, the `time2` parameter is the difference `time2 - time1`, and the `time3` parameter is the difference `time3 - time1`. This is exactly the same as we have seen previously with any linear model containing a categorical predictor variable. The *fixed-effects* therefore give us our predictions for the *marginal* means.

The `Residual` term corresponds to $\\eta_{ij}$ and thus the estimate of $\\sigma^{2}_{w} = 0.30^{2} = 0.09$.

    "Although the amount of data in this example makes the distributional form harder to verify, the key elements to notice here are that both distributions are centred on 0. So the expected values of both $\\xi_{i}$ and $\\eta_{ij}$ are 0. This is why the expected population effect is driven purely by the fixed-effects because, on average, the errors are 0. Secondly, the distribution of $\\xi_{i}$ is *much wider* than the distribution of $\\eta_{ij}$. This is because the distribution of $\\xi_{i}$ reflects measurements from *different subjects* and the distribution of $\\eta_{ij}$ reflects measurements from the *same subject*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see the fundamental assumption behind treating `id` as a *random-effect*. When we do this, we conceptualise each level of `id` as a random draw from a larger population of subjects. We therefore assume some distributional form for the *subject* effects and estimate its variance. This is the distribution we see in the plot above. If we instead treated `id` as a *fixed-effect*, we assume that each of its levels represents some population-level constant that we want to estimate. There would be no distribution and no variance to estimate. We would be effectively saying that we are only interested in *these subjects* and no one else. We want to *precisely* know the mean of `id == '32'` and make comparisons and inference on `id == 32` compared to `id == 42` or `id == 44` or between any pairs of subjects. It would be like treating the levels of `id` in the same way as the levels of `time`. Although there may be cases where the subjects that you have are *special* and each one is *meaningful* on their own, this is not our usual aim when we collect a sample. So, for most experiments, the subjects *have* to be treated as a *random-effect* in order to make sense."

    "## Inference in Mixed-effects Models\n",
    "As a final topic in this lesson, we return to the controversial subject of *inference*. As we know from previous lessons, assuming a more general form for the covariance structure $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ causes problems for the classical inferential framework. This is precisely because the distributions of the variance terms are no longer known. Traditionally, the variance has a scaled $\\chi^{2}$ distribution, whose width is parameterised by the degrees of freedom. Without this, the null distribution of the tests statics are unknown and the whole concept of error degrees of freedom disappears from our testing framework. Recall as well that there were then 3 possible solutions to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume we know $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and carry on as usual\n",
    "- Assume we know $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, but only because we have enough data and can use *asymptotic* results\n",
    "- Compensate by calculating *effective* degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we will briefly explore why all this remains relevant for mixed-effects models, by showing that a mixed-effects model is *equivalent* to a GLS model."

    "### The Implied Marginal Model\n",
    "Although we have been working on the basis that a hierarchical/LME model does not require direct consideration of the covariance structure, the covariance structure *still exists*. Unlike GLS, this structure is *implied* rather than directly specified. Nonetheless, we saw earlier in our simulations that a given covariance structure will emerge as a property of the random effects. Because of this, we can think of an LME model as *implying* the following *marginal* model of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y}_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mu},\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{i}\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we are assuming that $\\mathbf{y}_{i}$ is the vector of repeated measurements from subject $i$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is the vector of population means for the repeated measures and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{i}$ is block $i$ from the full covariance structure. Remember, this is *marginal* because the mean structure is the average across *all subjects*, rather than *conditional* on this specific subject. Of importance, is that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{i}$ can be formed *directly* from the random-effects. The way this is done requires more explanation of how LME models can be expressed using matrix notation and so is somewhat beyond our current score. Nevertheless, we can understand this from what we have seen previously where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{alignat*}{1}\n",
    "    \\text{Var}\\left(y_{ij}\\right) &= \\sigma^{2}_{b} + \\sigma^{2}_{w} \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{Cov}\\left(y_{ij},y_{ij^{\\prime}}\\right) &= \\sigma^{2}_{b} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{alignat*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which implies a compound symmetric structure based on the random effects alone. The big-picture conclusion here is that an LME model *is the same as GLS*, but with a more sophisticated way of constructing the variance-covariance matrix using the random effects. This leads to some important conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The concept of *removing* the covariance structure and then estimating the fixed-effects remains the *same* under an LME model.\n",
    "2. The inferential issues around GLS are *identical* for LME models.\n",
    "3. The covariance structure is *more restricted* under LME models, because it is constrained by the random effects themselves. "

    "Although we are somewhat focusing on shared *disadvantages*, it is important to recognise that all the *advantages* of GLS are also still here. For instance, the correct error term for each test can be automatically generated from the covariance structure. So while a model may be no better than the repeated measures ANOVA in its covariance assumptions, it is infinitely *more practical* because we do not need to mess around manually assigning error terms to different tests (and worrying about getting this wrong). \n",

    "Additionally, the connection between the random-effects and the covariance structure implies that *more complex* random-effect specifications will lead to different covariance structures. Indeed, this is exactly the case. Where this is useful is when we have more complex data structures. Because the random-effects are a direct consequence of the structure of the data, the structure drives the covariance pattern. This means we do not have to reason about what pattern we want and whether we can express this to a function like `gls()`. Instead, we supply the data structure through the random-effects and the covariance is built for us, no matter its complexity. This is something that will become clearer when we start exploring more complex data structures *next week*."

    "As we can see, this returns an output very similar to what we have seen before from `lm()` and `gls()`. The main additional information we have compared to simply printing the model (as we did earlier) is the table of coefficients associated with the *fixed-effects*. However, notice two important details from the `gls()` output\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Degrees of freedom and $t$-statistics are given, so this is *not* using and asymptotic approximation\n",
    "2. The degrees of freedom are *not* based on assuming that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is known as they are *smaller* than those reported by `gls()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is this output doing? It is using *effective* degrees of freedom to specify the tests, using the *structure* built-in to the LME model. Now, the method used is fairly basic and is given by a heuristic described more fully in [Pinheiro and Bates (2000, pg.91)](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Mixed_Effects_Models_in_S_and_S_PLUS/y54QDUTmvDcC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=pinheiro+and+bates+2000&printsec=frontcover). Nevertheless, this tells us something important about LME models. Because the data structure is embedded in the model specification, we can more readily use this structure to make better approximations to the uncertainty around the variance terms. A GLS model has *no knowledge* of the structure. It just see a single covariance matrix of any structure that it can remove. So even though the heuristic used by `lme()` is a very basic approximation, it does agree with the classical specification of degrees of freedom in a repeated measures ANOVA. So, at the *very least* we are back in familiar territory."
