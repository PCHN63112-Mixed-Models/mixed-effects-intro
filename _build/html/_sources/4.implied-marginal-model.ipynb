    "... Importantly, this means that estimation reduces to the *same idea* as GLS, where the implied covariance structure is removed from the data and a normal linear model fit on the result. So, from this perspective, we can conceptualise mixed-effects model in *exactly the same way* as GLS. This means that all the inferential problems we discussed last week *still apply* for mixed-effects models."

    "... The advantage is that mixed-effects models capture more *structure* than GLS models. This means that mixed-effects models embed *where* the correlation came from. Having that structure in terms of the random effects allows for slightly more sophisticated approaches to the problem of *effective degrees of freedom*. Because the covariance structure can be decomposed into the random effects, the data structure itself is part of the model of the covariance matrix. This means there is information available that can be used to construct more sophisticated faux degrees of freedom. This information is not there using GLS, because there is only a single big covariance structure that cannot be decomposed into anything related to the model. \n",

    "Now, of course, this is only an advantage if you agree with the notion of effective degrees of freedom. If you do not, then this new information is still not useful."
