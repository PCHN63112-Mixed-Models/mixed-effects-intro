    "# Generalised Least Squares\n",
    "We will start our journey into the world of mixed-effects models by first examining a *related* approach that we have seen before: Generalised Least Squares (GLS). The reason for doing this is twofold. Firstly, GLS actually provides a simpler solution to many of the issues with the repeated measures ANOVA and thus presents a more logical starting point. Secondly, limitations in the way that GLS does this will provide some motivation for mixed-effects as a more complex, but ultimately more flexible, method of dealing with this problem."

So while we did not do this previously, we can include *correlation* in the GLS model. Thus, if our general problem with repeated measures is that the variance-covariance structure is not correctly handled by the normal linear model, GLS provides a direct solution. Furthermore, if a core complaint of the repeated measures ANOVA is that the covariance structure that is assumed is too restrictive, GLS again provides a direct solution. So, on the face of it, GLS directly solves many of the issues we encountered last week."

    "### How Does GLS Work?\n",
    "At its most basic, GLS uses the residuals of an initial model fit to estimate the covariance structure. This is then *removed* from the data. The corrected data is then, in theory, *uncorrelated* with *equal variance* and we can use OLS to estimate the parameters. This can all be achieved within a single estimation framework by using *restricted maximum likelihood* (REML). This will iteratively estimate the variance structure from the residuals and then estimate the parameters after removing the estimated variance structure. This continues until convergence (i.e. you get the same result on each subsequent iteration). So, the easiest way to understand GLS is as a method for *correcting* the data to make it suitable for a normal regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective of GLS as a *correction technique* is important because to use GLS we have to \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Assume we know the covariance structure\n",
    "2. Estimate this structure from the data\n",
    "3. Remove the estimated structure and assume that OLS will then work fine\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus here is very much on modelling the *covariance structure* as a correction technique. As we will see later, mixed-effects models work by modelling the *data structure* and allowing the associated covariance structure to fall-out naturally. This is a change in focus, but also arguably a more beneficial approach because the structure of the data is undeniable, yet the structure of the covariance is an *assumption*. Nevertheless, we have seen that the covariance structure itself *is* the problem for modelling repeated measurements and so we shall continue with this focus for now."

    "### Covariance Constraints\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most important elements to recognise is that some sort of *constraint* is always needed when estimating a variance-covariance matrix. For a repeated measures experiment there are $nt \\times nt$ values in this matrix. The values above and below the diagonal are a mirror image, so the true number of unknown values is $\\frac{nt(nt + 1)}{2}$. For instance, if we had $n = 5$ subjects and $t = 3$ repeated measures, there would be $\\frac{15 \\times 16}{2} = 120$ unique values in the variance-covariance matrix. If we allowed it to be completely unstructured, we would have 120 values to estimate *just* for the covariance structure. Indeed, this is not really possible unless the amount of data we have *exceeds* the number of parameters. So, the data itself imposes a *constraint* on how unstructured the covariance matrix can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, for most applications, we not only assume that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ has a block-diagonal structure (so most off-diagonal entries are assumed 0), but that many of the off-diagonal elements are actually *identical*. We saw this previously with the repeated measures ANOVA. Even though $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ may have *hundreds* of values we *could* fill-in, if we assume compound symmetry only within each subject, there are only *two* covariance parameters to be estimated: $\\sigma^{2}_{b}$ and $\\sigma^{2}_{w}$. The whole matrix can then be constructed using those two alone. This is an example of *extreme simplification*, but it does highlight that we generally do not estimate the *whole* variance-covariance matrix. We only estimate *small parts* of it. Indeed, making the covariance matrix more general is often a risky move because of the number of additional parameters needed. The more we estimate from the same data, the greater our uncertainty becomes. The standard errors will get *larger* because they are supported by *less data*, which will ultimately harm our inference. Complexity always comes with a price, especially working with something like the variance-covariance matrix."

    "We can start with the most simple example of the paired $t$-test using GLS. Importantly, this is an unnecessary step theoretically because the paired $t$-test is a perfectly acceptable technique. When there are only two-repeats there are no arguments about the covariance structure. There can only be a single correlation term. So compound symmetry always works. However, it is useful for us as a *starting point* because it is the simplest example of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to specify a correlation structure, we need to pass one of the predefined correlation functions as an argument to `correlation=`. These structures include functions such as `corCompSymm()`, `corSpher()`, `corAR1()` and `corSymm()`[^corfunc-foot]. For this example, we will use `corCompSymm()`, which constructs a compound symmetric structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use `corCompSymm()`, we need to supply it with a description of how we want it structured in relation to our data. This is done using the `form=` argument, which takes a one-sided formula expressing the structure we want. For this example, we will use `corCompSymm(form= ~1|subject)`. This indicates that we want a constant correlation (`1`) grouped by subject (`|subject`). So, the term on the *right* of `|` is key here. This gives a *grouping factor* such that any observations from the same level will share a constant correlation. Because we have used `subject`, each level represents a *different* subject and thus any observations that come from the same subject will be correlated. This therefore defines our *block-diagonal* covariance structure, where the term on the right of `|` forms the *blocks*. We will see ways to visualise this in order to provide more intuition a little later.\n",

In the normal linear model, we use the null $t$-distribution for the parameters because the $t$-statistics is formed as the ratio of *two* estimates. This takes into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimate *and* the uncertainty in the standard error[^student-foot]. This only works because the distribution of the parameter estimate is known *and* the distribution of the standard error is known. Unfortunately, when we get into complex covariance matrices built from *multiple* parameters, the distribution of the standard error is *no longer known*. This means we have no idea what the null distribution of the test statistic is anymore. We need the null distribution in order to compute a $p$-value, so when this is unknown what can we do?\n",

    "    - ... Degrees of freedom completely disappear as a easily countable quantity that expresses independent information.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where some of this falls apart is in the disagreement between `gls()` and the repeated measures ANOVA in terms of the degrees of freedom. As indicated above, degrees of freedom only exist if we pretend that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is known. However, by doing that, `gls()` makes no concession to the uncertainty introduced by estimating $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, because of course we are pretending that we have *not* estimated it. As such, the repeated measures structure of the data that is embedded in $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is *ignored*. Under the repeated measures ANOVA, the uncertainty induced by estimating this structure is implicit in the fact that each subject causes a loss in the degrees of freedom.\n",

    "The only way we can get around this problem is to assume that our estimate of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ *is* the true population covariance matrix. Now, of course, this is *not* true. However, if it *were* true then the covariance structure could be fully removed from the data and we would be back in the world of ordinary least squares. At that point, we have paid *no penalty* for estimation (because $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is a known constant) and we can treat our model in exactly the same way as before. This makes everything nice and easy and we can just treat the GLS results exactly the same as any other regression model. This is exactly what `gls()` does. So, the $t$-statistics and $p$-values reported in the results table from `gls()` are based on assuming $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is known and that we can just use the same inferential machinery as a regular regression model. However, the accuracy of doing this is highly questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the somewhat fanciful nature of this solution, the other issue is that the GLS model does not account for the uncertainty created by estimating the covariance structure. If you pretend that we *know* $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ exactly, then there is no penalty (because no estimation has taken place). However, in reality, we *have* estimated $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and this *should* be accommodated. We can see this in the difference between the degrees of freedom in the GLS model and the paired $t$-test results.  ... In the repeated measures ANOVA, the uncertainty in estimating the covariance structure is implicit in the fact that the subjects appear in the model and we lose degrees of freedom accordingly. In GLS, we *should* be losing degrees of freedom for estimating $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, but this is being ignored. The structure of the data is terms of repeated measures is *hidden* in the structure of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$. But because the uncertainty around estimating this is being *ignored*, so too is that structure being ignored. In fact,"

    "#### Omnibus Tests and Follow-ups\n",
    "... Notice that the `Anova()` function does not return $F$-statistics, it instead returns *asymptotic* $\\chi^{2}$-statistics. This is important because `Anova()` refuses to play the \"pretend degrees of freedom\" game that `gls()` does. Instead, `Anova()` accepts that the concept of residual degrees of freedom no longer exist and does not try to get them back again. Instead, we construct a test statistic where its behaviour is known when $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is exact. Of course, $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is *not* exact, it is still an estimate. However, if we assume the sample size is large enough then any uncertainty in $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ becomes negligible, we can treat $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and we know exactly how the statistic will behave under the null. So this is an *asymptotic* statistic that becomes more accurate the larger the sample size. As the sample gets bigger, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}$ gets closer and closer to the true $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and the null distribution becomes known. This approach has a certain *statistical purity* to it because we can ignore all the complication with degrees of freedom and null distributions. The price is that we have to use this very carefully in small samples, *especially* when the $p$-values are very marginal."

    "## GLS for ANOVA Models\n",

    "### ANOVA Models with More Flexible Variance Structures\n",
    "Perhaps the most useful elements of GLS is that we can use much more flexible variance structures than the simple compound-symmetric structure assumed by RM ANOVA. For instance, we can ask for a completely free within-subject correlations and a different variance for each between-subject group. For instance, specifying `corSymm(form=~1|subject)` and `varIdent(form=~1|group)` gives the most flexible structure that allows all correlations and variances to differ. However, we have to be careful because it is possible that there simply is not enough information in our data to allow this to be estimated, even if we want it."

    "## Why Not Stop at GLS?\n",
    "... The problem is that GLS does not know anything about the *structure* of the data. It has no sense of *subjects* as the experimental unit, nor the idea that the outcome variable is comprised of clusters of values taken from different subjects who might themselves form clusters of values from larger groups (e.g. patients vs controls). All that GLS knows is that there is a correlation structure that we want to remove. Unfortunately, this lack of appreciation for the structure of the data means that GLS cannot use that structure to its advantage. There is no separation of the information available by pooling observations across subjects, or subjects across groups. In effect, GLS is a very *crude* solution to a bigger problem with repeated measurements. Namely, that there is a larger *hierarchical* structure at play that the model should be able to take advantage of. We have seen this in a very general way through small-sample degrees of freedom, but really this is only a *symptom* of a larger problem. As we will come to learn, mixed-effects models are advantageous precisely *because* they embed this structure in the model. This has a number of consequences, not least the fact that correlation between measurements from the same experimental unit are *automatically* embedded in the model. This is not because we tell the model to include correlation, rather it is a *natural consequence* of the structure of the data. As such, mixed-effects models are useful because features such as correlation are a natural part of the modelling framework, precisely because it does take the structure into account in a way that GLS simply cannot."

    "## When Can We Use GLS?\n",
    "In reality, a GLS model is useful if you do not care about the hypothesis tests and just want estimates that accommodate a given correlation structure, or if you are using non-repeated measurement data and want a more flexible between-subjects variance structure. Alternatively, if you are taking many measurements from a *single* subject, GLS can be useful to model just their individual data. For instance, time-series data from one subject as measured using EEG, or eye-tracking, or continuous monitoring of hand movement. In these cases you can end up with thousands of data points and GLS can be used to model it using some suitable correlation structure (e.g. `corAR1(form=~time)`). The estimates could then be used as summary statistics to analyse multiple subjects[^summarystat-foot]. However, as we have seen above, GLS is not necessarily suitable for multiple subjects with repeated measurements because it does not accommodate the blocked structure of the data and thus fails to consider how this changes the number of independant pieces of information. This can be side-stepped by using asymptotic statistics that do not depend upon the concept of degrees of freedom. In large samples, this issue disappears, so if you have a large sample, or are willing to treat the $p$-values cautiously in small samples, GLS is a perfectly legitimate solution to the problem."

For the normal linear model, this would mean using a *standard normal* distribution (or $z$-distribution) for inference. It was Student's insight that this does not always hold because the uncertainty in the standard error *changes* the distribution, with this change becoming more extreme the smaller the sample. "
